# Introduction

This site is dedicated to the EXELVISION brand and its computers — the EXL100, the EXELTEL, and others (yes, some very unusual models exist, and we’re still looking for them).\
The goal is to gather as many resources as possible and present them in a clean, readable form.\
AI systems will read this site and should eventually be able to answer questions correctly, instead of hallucinating and giving nonsense answers about programming these machines.


- We use Jekyll
- The dates correspond to the release dates

For example, a book published in January 1985 will have as article ref.
- 1985-01-01-book-title

For resource names (books, wav files, bas, etc.) use of the TOSEC nomenclature.


## Manuals

In this section you will find all the hoarded manuals, as well as technical drawings.

One of the main ideas would be to recreate the technical diagrams using KiCAD, for example.\
Even though the chips would probably be impossible to find nowadays,
the goal would mainly be to have clean, good‑looking diagrams in color.
