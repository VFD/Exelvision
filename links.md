- David H Ahl

This repository concerns the publications of David H. Ahl.  
The goal is to archive and evaluate them to see whether they can be adapted to the Obscure Systems listed above.  
It’s a long‑term project.  
French versions will also need to be produced, which should be easier since the original U.S. editions are available.

- RPUFOS

This repository is currently undergoing a complete overhaul.  
It previously hosted the work of David H. Ahl.  
The goal is to turn it into a small blog for the RPUFOS project,  
and possibly merge it with **RPUFOS-TOOLS**.
