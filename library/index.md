# The Library

___
## Introduction

Here you’ll find books, articles, and even fanzines (Editor’s note: assuming we ever manage to find one someday).

As for the manuals, you’ll find them in the directory that proudly bears their name.

We’ve found plenty of material in French, but nothing in English or any other language so far.
We would be very interested in sharing such content here if anyone has it.

___
## What we have

Books and articles pulled from various magazines.\
Only the parts about the Obscure System made the cut — we spared you the rest.

### Books

- 102 Programmes, PSI.
- EXL100 à l'école, PSI.
- EXL100, Jeux d'action, SYBEX
- Maitrisez votre EXL100, MicroSystemes ETSF
- 35 programmes EXL100, Minipuce
- Programmez vos texte avec Exelvision, CNDP
- Programmez en assembleur sur Exelvision, Glajean

And yes! They’re all in French.

### Articles

The best ones are from Hebdogiciel. Ah, L'Hebdo… back when chaos was printed weekly and nobody complained because it was hilarious.\
If you’re learning French, this is a must‑read Best Of.

### Fanzines

Sorry we have found nothing.\
So don’t hesitate to let us know if you uncover anything during your archaeological digs.
