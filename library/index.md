## Introduction

Here you’ll find books, articles, and even fanzines (Editor’s note: assuming we ever manage to find one someday).

As for the manuals, you’ll find them in the directory that proudly bears their name.

We’ve found plenty of material in French, but nothing in English or any other language so far.
We would be very interested in sharing such content here if anyone has it.
